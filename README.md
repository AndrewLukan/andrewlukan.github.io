Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

This was a 24 hour game jam, but in reality it was was less. The jam officially started at 9PM, and the venue closed at 11PM. We started developing the next day at 9:30 AM until 10:30 PM to allow the build to export and submit.
