## Projects
### Senior Capstone Project

In this year-long project, we were tasked with creating a vertical slice for a video game. I was the designer in my team. I created the thematic, aesthetic and core gameplay pillars of our game, then ran it by my teammates. I was the communication between my teammates' progress and my producer. We discussed the limits of implementation, working with programmers and artists to make sure the work was reasonable and done on time, and decided to go about each week in a waterfall methodology of development. I needed to adjust the scope of the design's aspects as the project was ongoing, adding and cutting concepts as the schedule allowed. I learned about a designer's role of being the vision for the team. Several times, members weren't completely in sync with the design. I created reference videos for my animator, documented references for my 3D modelers, and wrote out flowcharts for the gameplay and level progression.

This was a 24 hour game jam, but in reality it was was less. The jam officially started at 9PM, and the venue closed at 11PM. We started developing the next day at 9:30 AM until 10:30 PM to allow the build to export and submit.
